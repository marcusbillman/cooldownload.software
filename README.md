# cooldownload.software

A really sketchy link shortener. Make any link look questionable and add janky CAPTCHA challenges to mess with people.

For example: [`youtube.com`](https://youtube.com) â†’ [`cooldownload.marcusbillman.com/bitcoin.fr-fast.account.docx/support-0OMBJkqyHb2.2mM-3uM2.mov.online`](cooldownload.marcusbillman.com/bitcoin.fr-fast.account.docx/support-0OMBJkqyHb2.2mM-3uM2.mov.online)

After clicking the link, one must complete lovely CAPTCHAs such as
* Wait
* 3D Text
* Rotate Image
* Select Squares

**Try it out at [cooldownload.marcusbillman.com](https://cooldownload.marcusbillman.com)**.

*(The app used to be hosted on the domain cooldownload.software, which looked even sketchier than the current URL.)*
